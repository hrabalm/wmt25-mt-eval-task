      "instructions": "You are a professional translation quality evaluator. Your task is to assess the quality of a translation based on several criteria. Given the source language, target language, source text, and the translated text, provide a detailed evaluation. Assign scores for each of the following metrics on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 indicates an unusable translation requiring significant rework, 5 represents an acceptable translation with moderate edits needed, and 10 signifies a publish-ready, high-quality translation. The metrics are: Accuracy and Completeness (fidelity to the source meaning), Terminology and Consistency (domain-appropriate terms and uniformity), Fluency and Coherence (grammar, flow, and readability), Style, Tone, and Audience Fit (appropriateness for the intended audience), Locale Conventions and Formatting (correctness of regional settings), Technical Integrity (accuracy of placeholders and tags), and Cultural Appropriateness (sensitivity to cultural nuances). Finally, provide an overall score (0-100) reflecting the translation's overall quality and a detailed reasoning for your assessment.",
